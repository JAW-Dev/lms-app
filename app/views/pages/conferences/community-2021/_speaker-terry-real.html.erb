  Terry Real is an internationally recognized Family Therapist, Speaker and Author. Terry founded
  the&nbsp;Relational Life Institute (RLI), offering workshops for couples, individuals and parents
  around the country along with a professional training program for clinicians wanting to learn his
  RLT (Relational Life Therapy) methodology. A family therapist and teacher for more than twenty
  five years, Terry is the best-selling author of I Don’t Want to Talk About It: Overcoming the
  Secret Legacy of Male Depression (Scribner, 1997), the straight-talking How Can I Get Through to
  You? Reconnecting Men and Women (Scribner, 2002), and most recently The New Rules of Marriage:
  What You Need to Make Love Work (Random House). Terry knows how to lead couples on a step-by-step
  journey to greater intimacy — and greater personal fulfillment.

  A senior faculty member of the Family Institute of Cambridge in Massachusetts and a retired
  Clinical Fellow of the Meadows Institute in Arizona, Terry has worked with thousands of
  individuals, couples, and fellow therapists. Through his books, the Institute, and workshops
  around the country, Terry helps women and men, parents and non-parents, to help them create the
  connection they desire in their relationships. Terry’s work, with its rigorous commonsense
  approach, speaks to both men and women. His ideas on men’s issues and on couple’s therapy have
  been celebrated in venues from the Good Morning America, The Today Show and 20/20, to Oprah and
  The New York Times.

  A proponent of “full-throttle marriage,” as described in The New Rules of Marriage, Terry has been
  called “the most innovative voice in thinking about and treating men and their relationships in
  the world today.”
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.75em;">
  The New York Times Book Review described Terry’s work as: “A critical contribution to feminist
  psychology (that) brings the Men’s movement a significant step forward.” Robert Bly hailed it as
  “moving onto new ground in both story and song. Exhilarating in its honesty.”

  Terry’s Relational Life Institute grew out of his extensive and empathic experience. He teaches
  people how to make their relationships work by providing products and services designed to teach
  the principles of Relational Life™, so that everyone can enjoy full respect living and craft a
  healthy life legacy.
